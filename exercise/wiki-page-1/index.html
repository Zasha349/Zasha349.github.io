            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also canopy disengagement,[1] canopy shyness,[2] or 
            inter-crown spacing[3]) is a phenomenon observed in some tree 
            species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch 
            each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.[4][5] The 
            phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but 
            also occurs between trees of different species.[6][7] There exist 
            many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, 
            and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating 
            insect larvae.[8]
