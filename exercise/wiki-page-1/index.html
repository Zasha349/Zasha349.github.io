            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>,
            <sup>[1]</sup> <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or 
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed 
            in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees 
            do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.
            <sup>[4][5]</sup> The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of 
            the same species, but also occurs between trees of different 
            species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why 
            crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that 
            it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
            <sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific 
            literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses 
            and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple 
            mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent 
            evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during 
            winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. 
            Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced 
            by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup>
            If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the 
            winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This 
            explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same 
            organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is 
            particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, 
            including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early 
            succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in 
            lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup> According to this theory, 
            variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly influences the 
            degree of crown shyness.
