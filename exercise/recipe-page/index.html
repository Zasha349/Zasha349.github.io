        <h1>PREPARING THE CROISSANTS</h1>
        <p>
            First, let’s get our croissants ready. Preheat your oven to 350°F 
            (175°C). Slice the top off each croissant and gently carve out the 
            center, creating a boat-like shape. Be careful not to cut through 
            the bottom or sides—you want to create a perfect little vessel for 
            our delicious fillings. Once you’ve carved out the center, press 
            down to make a well, ensuring there’s enough space for the eggs and 
            other ingredients. This step is crucial as it creates a sturdy base 
            to hold all the tasty ingredients without spilling over. You can 
            buy croissants from anywhere but my favorites are from Costco or 
            Sam’s Club.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>METHOD #1: BEEF BACON AND CHEDDAR</h1>
        <p>
            For our first method, we’ll start with the classic bacon and 
            cheddar combination. Add shredded cheddar cheese to the bottom of 
            each croissant well. Place a strip of beef bacon on top of that 
            into the well of each croissant. You can cut the strip of bacon in 
            half to make it easier to place inside. No need to pre-cook the 
            bacon—it will cook perfectly in the oven and infuse the croissant 
            with its savory flavor. Now, crack an egg into each croissant boat, 
            directly on top of the bacon and cheese. Season with salt and black 
            pepper to taste. Add a little bit more cheddar cheese on top. You 
            can opt to only add cheese on top and not in the bottom of the well 
            too. The cheese on top will get more crispy while the cheese 
            underneath will get ooey and gooey so pick your preference or go 
            for both
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Place the filled croissants on a baking sheet and pop them in the 
            oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the 
            croissants are golden brown. Make sure to take them out before the 
            egg yolks completely harden. The best texture is a jammy yolk – not
            too runny and not too firm
        </p>
        <h4>Tips and Tricks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Cheese Choices</b>: Feel free to substitute the cheddar with 
                other cheeses like mozzarella or gouda for different flavors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Protein Choice</b>: You can swap the beef bacon for turkey 
                bacon or use deli meat like turkey ham or even pastrami.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Seasoning</b>: Add a dash of paprika or chili flakes for a 
                bit of a kick.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Air Fryer Option:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your air fryer to 320°F (160°C).</li>
            <li>Place the filled croissants in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>
                Cook for 10-12 minutes, checking halfway through to ensure 
                even cooking.
            </li>

        >
        <h1>METHOD #2: TOMATO, BASIL, AND FETA</h1>
        <p>
            While those are baking, let’s move on to the tomato, basil, and feta 
            variation. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, salt, black pepper, 
            and a pinch of Italian seasoning. This will give our eggs a nice, 
            herby flavor. Stir in the diced grape tomatoes, chopped basil, and 
            crumbled feta cheese. The tomatoes add a juicy, slightly sweet 
            burst of flavor, while the basil brings in a fresh, aromatic note, 
            and the feta offers a tangy creaminess. Spoon the egg mixture into 
            the remaining croissants, filling them evenly. Place these on 
            another baking sheet and bake alongside the bacon and cheddar 
            croissants for 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the 
            croissants are golden brown.
        </p>
        <h4>Tips and Tricks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Tomato Prep</b>: Pat the diced tomatoes dry with a paper 
                towel to prevent excess moisture in the croissants.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cheese Variations</b>: Swap out the feta for goat cheese or 
                ricotta for a different texture and flavor. You could even add 
                cottage cheese for a protein boost.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fresh Herbs</b>: Substitute basil with fresh parsley or 
                chives for a different twist.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Egg Whites</b>: To make this lighter, you can just use 
                carton egg whites instead of whole eggs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Air Fryer Option:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your air fryer to 320°F (160°C).</li>
            <li>Place the filled croissants in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>
                Cook for 10-12 minutes, checking halfway through to ensure 
                even cooking.
            </li>
