        <h1>PREPARING THE CROISSANTS</h1>
        <p>
            First, let’s get our croissants ready. Preheat your oven to 350°F 
            (175°C). Slice the top off each croissant and gently carve out the 
            center, creating a boat-like shape. Be careful not to cut through 
            the bottom or sides—you want to create a perfect little vessel for 
            our delicious fillings. Once you’ve carved out the center, press 
            down to make a well, ensuring there’s enough space for the eggs and 
            other ingredients. This step is crucial as it creates a sturdy base 
            to hold all the tasty ingredients without spilling over. You can 
            buy croissants from anywhere but my favorites are from Costco or 
            Sam’s Club.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>METHOD #1: BEEF BACON AND CHEDDAR</h1>
        <p>
            For our first method, we’ll start with the classic bacon and 
            cheddar combination. Add shredded cheddar cheese to the bottom of 
            each croissant well. Place a strip of beef bacon on top of that 
            into the well of each croissant. You can cut the strip of bacon in 
            half to make it easier to place inside. No need to pre-cook the 
            bacon—it will cook perfectly in the oven and infuse the croissant 
            with its savory flavor. Now, crack an egg into each croissant boat, 
            directly on top of the bacon and cheese. Season with salt and black 
            pepper to taste. Add a little bit more cheddar cheese on top. You 
            can opt to only add cheese on top and not in the bottom of the well 
            too. The cheese on top will get more crispy while the cheese 
            underneath will get ooey and gooey so pick your preference or go 
            for both
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Place the filled croissants on a baking sheet and pop them in the 
            oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the 
            croissants are golden brown. Make sure to take them out before the 
            egg yolks completely harden. The best texture is a jammy yolk – not
            too runny and not too firm
